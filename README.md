# TO DO LIST using Python

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application built with python. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks directly from the terminal.

The goal of this project is to practice core Python concepts such as:

- Functions
- Lists and dictionaries
- Loops and conditionals
- File handling
- Basic user input validation

## Features

- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Persistent storage using a text file

## How it works

The app runs in the terminal and displays a menu of options. Users interact with the program by entering numbers corresponding to actions. Tasks are saved locally so they remain available after restarting the program.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Navigate into the project directory: cd to-do-app
3. Run the program: python todo.py
